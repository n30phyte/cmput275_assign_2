Description:
Implement individual component counter for a given graph object read in from
provided file path in arguments

Instructions:
Compile code using the makefile, creating object files first, then executable
(See Makefile targets information below)
Run application using: ./graph_concepts [FILENAME]

Makefile Targets:
 - graph_concepts.o: build graph_concepts object file
 - digraph.o: build digraph object file
 - graph_concepts: build graph_concepts application

Note:
This code was designed specifically in mind to work for both undirected and directed graphs
