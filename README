Description:
Arduino pathfinder server and client
Server communicates to client a shortest path between two places on a map
Client (Arduino) displayes the path on a given map of Edmonton

Acknowledgements:
Some code was adapted from previous weekly problems, or built off of provided code from eClass



SERVER INFORMATION:

Source location: server/

Included Files:
 - server/dijkstra.h
 - server/heap.h
 - server/wdigraph.h
 - server/digraph.h
 - server/server.cpp
 - server/dijkstra.cpp
 - server/edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt
 - server/Makefile
 - server/digraph.cpp
 - server/serialport.cpp
 - server/serialport.h

Instructions:
 - Go into the server folder
 - Compile code using the Makefile
 - (See Makefile targets information below)
 - Run application using: ./server
 - Note: Run the server application after client has started
 - Note: Server might be bound to a different port than expected
         This can be changed in the source code in the main.cpp file (line 19)

Makefile Targets:
 - server: build server application, depends on following objects
 - server.o: build server object file
 - digraph.o: build digraph object file
 - dijkstra.o: build dijkstra object file



CLIENT INFORMATION:

Source location: client/

Included files:
 - client.cpp
 - consts_and_types.h
 - draw_route.h
 - draw_route.cpp
 - lcd_image.cpp
 - lcd_image.h
 - Makefile
 - map_drawing.cpp
 - map_drawing.h
 - serial_handling.cpp
 - serial_handling.h

Wiring:
Mount the TFT display on the Arduino lining up power ports

Joystick:
VRx <--> A8
VRy <--> A9
SW  <--> Digital Pin 53
GND <--> GND
+5V <--> 5V

Zoom Out Button <--> Digital Pin 47
Zoom In Button  <--> Digital Pin 45

Instructions:
 - Connect Arduino
